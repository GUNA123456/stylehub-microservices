# Phase 2: this was a stub — a hardcoded PID list and random.sample, zero outbound calls,
# which left the recommendation->catalog edge declared in the topology but nonexistent in
# reality (one of the three "phantom edges" the discovered graph exposed). Now the
# recommendations come from the live catalog, related-by-category to the seed products.
#
# Failure policy: the catalog is this service's ONLY reason to exist, so a catalog failure
# is a 502 here — and the FRONTEND degrades gracefully (recommendations are on its
# documented optional list). Net effect of a catalog kill: rec->catalog error edge, then
# frontend->rec error edge, while the product page itself still renders. A second,
# distinct cascade shape for the model to learn.
